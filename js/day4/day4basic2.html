<!-- Basic 2 | Truncate

Create a truncate function that accepts two parameters. 1st parameters is a string and the 2nd is number of characters that should be truncated - shorten by cutting off the string from left to right.

For ex. If we pass the following arguments in the function 1st argument = "I am a hero from World of Warcraft" and 2nd argument = "12", we should get just the string "I am a hero"
