    <!-- Basic 1 | Reading Status

Based on data stored within the library array, create a JavaScript program that will iterate through the array and will provide the output based on the reading status. If the user has read the book, print on the screen "Already read <name_of_the_book>, otherwise print "You still need to read <name_of_the_book>". Also make a clear graphical division between the both reading statuses.
