			Young, the former star at Texas, has not played in an NFL regular-season game since 2011 and retired from football in 2014.
			</p>
			<p>
			The Spring League, an independent four-team football league made up of free agents that debuts in April, has publicly expressed interest in adding Young, the former No. 3 overall pick who earned Rookie of the Year honors and made the Pro Bowl in 2006 and 2009 during his six years in the NFL.

			Young last attempted a comeback in 2014, a brief offseason stint with the Cleveland Browns. He signed following a minicamp tryout but was cut days after the Browns drafted Johnny Manziel. Before that, Young was cut by the Green Bay Packers in the preseason in 2013.
