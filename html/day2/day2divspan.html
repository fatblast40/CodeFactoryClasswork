		<p>
			<span style="color: red">Waiting in a car</span> <br>
			Waiting for a ride in the dark <br>
			The night city grows <br>
			Look at the horizon glow <br>
			Waiting in a car <br>
			Waiting for a ride in the dark <br>
			Drinking in the lights <br>
			Following the neon signs <br>
			Waiting for a word <br>
			Looking at the milky skyline <br>
			The city is my church <br>
			It wraps me in its blinding twilight <br>
			Waiting in a car <br>
			Waiting for the right time <br>
			Waiting inâ€¦ <br>
